    <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher specializing in robotics, with a particular focus on soft robotics, bio-inspired robotics, and soft sensing. My research explores hybrid variable stiffness co-bot systems, fully soft continuum robots, and soft tactile sensors, aiming to enhance adaptability, functionality, and interaction in robotic systems. I am particularly interested in expanding the application boundaries of soft robotics into healthcare, industry, domestic assistance, and underwater exploration.</p>
